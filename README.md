Predicts student pass/fail outcomes using logistic regression based on study hours and attendance.


# 📊 Student Performance Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project builds a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on two features: **Hours Studied** and **Attendance Percentage**.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To predict a student's outcome (Pass/Fail) using Logistic Regression based on their study habits and attendance.

---

## 📁 Dataset

A manually created dataset of 20 records with the following columns:

- `Hours_Studied` (Number of hours a student studied)
- `Attendance` (Percentage of attendance)
- `Pass_Fail` (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Steps Followed

1. **Created a dataset manually** in the notebook.
2. **Visualized** the data to understand the relationship.
3. **Split** the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Trained** a Logistic Regression model.
5. **Evaluated** the model using accuracy and classification metrics.
6. **Predicted** new student outcomes based on custom input.

---

## 📈 Sample Output

```bash
Accuracy: 0.83
Predictions for new data (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail): [0 1 0 1 1]

💡 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.


2. Open Student_Performance_Prediction_Expanded.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.


3. Run all cells to train the model and make predictions.
